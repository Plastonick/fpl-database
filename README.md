## WIP

### TODO

- Add SQL diagram to visualise relations in the README

### Fantasy Premier League Database

This project creates a pre-hydrated database with data taken from [vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League](https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League). Allows for reading data for other projects without needing to parse the [vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League](https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League) file system. This links teams and players across seasons, so inter-seasonal trends can more easily be established. 


### Known Issues

- Home/away fixture difficulties for the 2016-17 season are not included

### Usage

#### Docker

Start and run a postgres database server listening on port 5432.

```
docker run --rm -p 5432:5432 davidpugh/fpl-database:latest
```

### Example

Find the top 5 scoring players in a single game week:

```sql
select s.name                 as season,
       p.first_name,
       p.second_name,
       sum(pp.total_points)   as game_week_points,
       count(f.fixture_id)    as num_fixtures
from fixtures f
         inner join player_performances pp on f.fixture_id = pp.fixture_id
         inner join players p on pp.player_id = p.player_id
         inner join seasons s on f.season_id = s.season_id
group by f.season_id, f.event, s.name, p.first_name, p.second_name
order by game_week_points desc
limit 5;
```
